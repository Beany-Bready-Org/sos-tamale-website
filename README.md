## Project Status 🔥

1. Earlier this year, we planned to implement an _admin dashboard_ to allow for administration of the website directly from certain authorized users.

   Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to implement. We estimate it could take as long as **6 months** to complete it. **The dashboard has been scrapped from our plans.**

2. We also planned a section displaying a _video tour_ of the school campus. **However we did not have enough time to record said video.**

3. We also had plans for a page indicating the school guidelines. **However we could not retrieve a soft copy of said guidelines.**

---

Currently, the project is 99% completed, with most of the work now being polishing and fine-tuning certain visuals, and looking for mistakes in our code.

It is ready for deployment/hosting, and, as of now, no major work is being done.

## Plans for the future 🗺️

We currently have **no plans** for the website as of October 2024. However routine checks and updates every few months will be necessary.
